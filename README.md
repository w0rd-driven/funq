*Project Description*
This project provides a high performance DI framework by eliminating all runtime reflection through the use of lambdas and generic functions as factories.

Developed entirely in C# using TDD, it's a container you can crack open and actually understand to the core.

To follow the entire process of creating Funq applying test-driven development, make sure you watch the [Funq Screencast Series](http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/archive/2009/02/02/116399.aspx)
